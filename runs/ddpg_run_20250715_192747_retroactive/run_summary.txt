Retroactively Organized Training Run: ddpg_run_20250715_192747_retroactive
Organized: Tue Jul 15 07:27:47 PM UTC 2025
Original SLURM output: slurm-1335771.out

This directory contains files from a DDPG training run that was executed
using the watgpu-partition_test-configs.yaml configuration.

From the SLURM output analysis:
- Training used CPU device (GPU was requested but fell back to CPU)
- Trained on 30 patients (adolescent, adult, child populations)
- Used DDPG algorithm with action noise (mean=0, sigma=0.25)
- Training completed 1000 timesteps across multiple patients
- Patient switching callback forced switches every 100 steps
